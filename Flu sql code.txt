1.) Total % of patients getting flu shots stratified by
   a.) Age
   b.) Race
   c.) County
   d.) Overall
2.) Running total of flu shots over the course 0f 2022 month by month
3.) Total number of flu shots given in 2022
4.) A list of Patients that show whether or not they recieved the flu shots

Requirements:
Patients must have been "Active in our hospital system"---Atleast the patient must have encounnet in the past 2/3 years
Patients should be alive.
Patient should be 6 months and older
*/


/*
race and county is in patients table
AGE has to be calculated from birthdate 
for running total and total number of flue shots can taken from immunization table filter by date
for finding the list of patient who have recieved flu shots we have to JOIN immunization with patient table

Retain only patients that are active in the hospital system
choose only alive patients so JOIN patients table with encounter
For filtering out patient less than 6 months of age, we need to calculate 'AGE'
data shuold be filtered at each step for only 2022 year

--Here we dont have repeating rows when we joined flu_shot_2022 with patients table as it was ONE TO ONE
--we did left join so that we can know who got the flushots and who doesnot
--To depict it very well we used case statement which show that patient row in flu table in the join will have null values,
    for rows of id in patients table who doesnot have recieved flu shots... so using CASE statement we have depicted those values more clearly who are not jabbed.
--active_patients CTE is also setup for one to one relationship so as to dodge rows duplication that could happen by directly joining the encounter table with patients
--First of all why are we making active_patients CTE---Inorder to satisfy the condition of active patient, From Encounter table we have reduced the patients who
   have encounter between specified dates.... This way we filter out all the rows from patient table who have encounters outside this date
--The WHERE 1=1 in this query serves as a placeholder condition to facilitate adding further filtering criteria, 
   such as and pat.id in (select patient from active_patients)
